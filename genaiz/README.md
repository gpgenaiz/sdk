## Makefile

Building the project with its associated make file can install the application, its manual pages and associated
resources. To install locally:

```shell
cd genaiz && make all
```

To build a docker image of the sdk

```shell
cd genaiz && make docker
```

To execute tests alone or to get coverage metrics

```shell
cd genaiz && make coverage
```

For more information about all provided targets

```shell
cd genaiz && make help
```

## Minimal Build

```shell
cd genaiz
go build
./genaiz --help
```

## Commands

### account (ac)

The account module is used to manage account credentials and configuration policies with an Orchestrating Broker.

#### activate

The activate command allows a user to switch from one account session to another without necessarily having to
re-authorize an expired session.

When the command activates a session that is not

```bash
genaiz ac activate --help
genaiz ac activate dev.genaiz.com
```

#### inspect

The inspect command allows a process to confirm session credentials. This was added for CI/CD scripts.

```bash
genaiz ac inspect --help
genaiz ac inspect
```

#### list

The list command displays a tab delimited table of account sessions available to the CLI. It can also display the
results as a JSON list.

It can use an argument to apply basic filtering to the list:

```bash
genaiz ac list --help
genaiz ac list dev.genaiz.com
genaiz ac list dev.genaiz.com --json
```

#### login

The login command obtains an identity token from the specified Orchestrating Broker and registers the current active
account for a specified amount of time by the broker.

```shell
genaiz ac login dev.genaiz.com
```

#### logout

The logout command is invoked to explicitly remove a known session id from the local sdk configuration. The file is
found under $HOME/.cache/genaiz/.auth. The command will log out the active session by default is no --host parameter is
specified.

```shell
genaiz ac logout
```

### function (sf)

The function module is used to manage smart functions and publish them as Docker images to an Orchestrating Broker.

```shell
genaiz sf --help
```

#### build

Simply builds the Smart Function image. Build should always be called as part of other commands, except stop, if no
image with the Function definition can be found.

```shell
genaiz sf build --help
```

#### create

The command creates a new Smart Function folder with a typical layout. By default, the command will ask the user
interactively to confirm all initial values assigned to the function. The layout created should have a genaiz.yaml file
populated with the values passed to this command.

```shell
genaiz sf create --help
```

#### init

The command initiates a new Smart Function under an existing folder. By default, the command will ask the user
interactively to confirm what it found under the folder, creating the genaiz.yaml file for the Smart Function.

```shell
genaiz sf init --help
```

#### list

The command lists all images with their versions belonging to Smart Function folder. In addition, it will list any local
containers configured with any of the listed images.

```shell
genaiz sf list --help
```

#### prop

The prop command allows management of property specifications for the Smart Function. Property specifications indicate
to runtime environments which environment variable the function expects.

```shell
genaiz sf prop --help
```

#### publish

The command initiates a session with the GenAIz broker retrieving authorization tokens to publish a Smart Function image
onto the GenAIz marketplace. This would require the user to be logged in using a **genaiz ac login** preamble to
retrieve licensing agreements.

```shell
genaiz sf publish --help
```

#### run

This should start the image with a disposable container in detached mode.

```shell
genaiz sf run --help
```

#### start

This should start the image with a named container, potentially replacing any existing one, and potentially disposing of
it after completion.

```shell
genaiz sf start --help
```

#### stop

This should stop a named container, potentially disposing of it after it exits.

```shell
genaiz sf stop --help
```

#### test

Similar to run, but starting a disposable container attached to the current shell.

```shell
genaiz sf test --help
```

### solution (sn)

The solution module allows a user to create a solution with a default workflow setting solution values which will be
used as default values for child components such as [workflows](#workflow-wf) and [functions](#function-sf).

#### create

Create initializes a new or an existing solution with the specified values. A solution must always have a workflow,
creating a solution implies creating a default workflow with default or specified values as well.

```shell
genaiz sn create --help
```

#### list

List is used to get list of solutions either from a local folder, from a specific account or from both ends.

```shell
genaiz sn list --help
```

#### publish

Publish is the command used to publish a Solution with its Workflows, and its local Smart Functions. The command will
iterate through all the Smart Functions found locally and invoke [genaiz sf publish](#publish)

```shell
genaiz sn publish --help
```

### workflow (wf)

The workflow module allows a user to create, add and remove workflow configurations from a solution file.

#### create

The create command takes an optional path, where a solution can be found, and adds a workflow to it. If no path is
supplied, the command reads the current working dir, if the path does not exist, it creates it. If the workflow already
exists an error is returned.

```shell
genaiz wf create --help
```

#### delete

The delete command removes a workflow from the current working dir solution. If the workflow does not exist, it returns
an error.

```shell
genaiz wf delete --help
```

#### links add/rm

The "links" commands can be used to add and remove links to and from an existing workflow. If the workflow does not
exist, it returns an error.

```shell
genaiz wf links --help
genaiz wf links add --help
genaiz wf links rm --help
```

#### nodes add/rm

The "nodes" commands can be used to add and remove nodes to and from an existing workflow. If the workflow does not
exist, it returns an error.

```shell
genaiz wf nodes --help
genaiz wf nodes add --help
genaiz wf nodes rm --help
```

### Workspace (ws)

The workspace module is used to create, list and manage workspaces with an associated account. A workspace is necessary
for being able to run workflows on a group of brokered agents.

#### create

The create command is a simple first step when configuring a workspace for an account.

```bash
genaiz ws create --help
```

#### list

The list command serves an intermediary command for IDE displaying a list of available workspaces to the user. For
subsequent Account Management commands the list is used to instruct adding building blocks to an enclosing workspace.

```bash
genaiz ws list --help
```

### Workspace Flow (ws flow)

Flow create is how a user instantiates a Solution he published into a Workspace for execution.

```bash
genaiz ws flow create --help
```
